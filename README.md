A Jeopardy! bot for Discord

![](https://i.imgur.com/QTts4bu.jpg)

This bot will keep track of your scores across all of your Discord channels. It is also fairly lenient with the answers to account for typos and misspellings.

**Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=400786664861204481&scope=bot&permissions=0) to add this bot to your Discord channels.**

Still a WIP! Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
